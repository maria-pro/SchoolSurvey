Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears; I come to bury Caesar,
not to praise him. The evil that men do lives after them; The good is
oft interred with their bones; So let it be with Caesar. The noble
Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious: If it were so, it was a
grievous fault, And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it. Here, under
leave of Brutus and the rest-- For Brutus is an honourable man; So are
they all, all honourable men-- Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral. He
was my friend, faithful and just to me: But Brutus says he was
ambitious; And Brutus is an honourable man. He hath brought many
captives home to Rome Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: Did
this in Caesar seem ambitious?
