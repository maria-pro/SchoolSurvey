<h1>Demographics of schools participating in the self-assessment tool: 2021 &amp; 2022</h1>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<p>**This is automated, so next time you do this report you just need to swap (=rename) the data file. If a different set of questions is used next time, this can be easily updated in the data dictionary file (data_dic.csv).*</p>
<p>*Also the text generation can be automated, so if you usually includes the same statistics in the description, these numbers can be drawn directly from data and inserted automatically, so you will just need to review the text**</p>
<p>In the 2022 evaluation, as in the 2021 evaluation, a majority of the participant were government schools. In 2022, 7 of the 12 participating schools were government schools, 4 were Catholic schools, and just 1 was an Independent school.</p>
<p><em>Chart notes</em>:</p>
<p><em>• The font on all of the pie charts is very small – probably too small for readers to make out. Is it possible to enlarge – similar to the 2021 report? NOTE that if this takes much time, just leave as is.</em></p>
<p><strong>I changed the font on Charts to Times New Romans, 14 - this can be adjusted easily, please confirm</strong></p>
<p><em>• I had originally asked for percentages to one decimal point, but given that there are now 0s for each data point, just leave them as whole numbers. So – 33% (rather than 33.0%)</em></p>
<p><strong>I changed this to integer with proper rounding</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It would also be nice if the legend and the pie pieces matched up, as they do in the 2021 report. So if Government is the first category listed in the legend, reading left to right, the Government pie piece is also on the left. NOTE: if this takes too much time, just leave as is.*</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>done - all pie charts are completely the same orientation as in the 2021 report, including the order of colours on the pie sections.</strong></p>

<p><em>Figure 1. Participants by school sector</em></p>
<p>Similar to 2021, in 2022 a large majority of participating schools were primary schools. In the 2022 evaluation, 9 of the 12 participating schools were Primary schools, with 2 combined schools and 1 secondary school. In the 2021 evaluation, more secondary schools than combined schools participated.</p>

<p><em>Figure 5. Participants by location: metro / non-metro</em></p>
<p>In 2022, schools were asked to respond to two sets of questions about their level of engagement with the eSmart Framework and eSmart Advisors. The Engagement A scale consisted of five questions about the frequency with which the schools engaged, with seven response options from “weekly” to “once a year” and “never”. The Engagement B scale consisted of six yes/no questions that asked whether the school had engaged with a variety of people, resources, and events. Schools were considered to have scored “High” on Engagement A if they scored 16 or more out of a total possible score of 35 and “Low” if they scored less than 16. Schools were considered to have scored “High” on Engagement B if they answered “yes” to 3 or more of the 6 questions; “Medium” if they answered “yes” to 1 or 2 of the 6 questions, and “Low” if they did not answer “yes” to any of the 6 questions.</p>
<p>Six of the 12 participating schools were characterised as having high engagement on the Engagement A scale and six were characterised as having low engagement. On the Engagement B scale, three schools were characterised as having high engagement, four as having a medium level of engagement, and five as having low engagement.</p>
<p><em>Could you change these to a different colour, as these are the colours used for schools sector. How about light and dark green for Engagement A and light and dark orange for Engagement B?</em> <strong>done</strong></p>

<p>The spread of resonses by schools was similar in 2022 and 2021, ranging from a low of 10 (2022) or 11 (2021) to a high of 23 (both years). Although patterns are more difficult to discern in 2022 with the small sample size, it appears that, similar to the results in 2021, government schools tended to report that they had achieved fewer action items than did Catholic schools.</p>

<p>The percentage achievement within each Domain for all schools that completed the SAT in 2021 or 2022 is presented below. In general, levels of achievement were slightly lower in 2022 than in 2021. As in 2021, highest scores in 2022 were for School plans, policies, and procedures, and A respectful and caring school community. The largest drop between 2021 and 2022 was in Effective school organisation. It is possible that COVID had a particularly negative impact on this Domain.</p>

<p>Results by Focus Area differed somewhat in 2022 compared to 2021. In 2022, the School Climate domain dropped from highest score to second-lowest score. This result may be due to the impact of COVID and associated school closures and switch to on-line learning. It may also be due simply to the small sample size in 2022. The highest score in 2022 was for the Response Focus Area. In both years, the Data domain was lowest or equal lowest.</p>

<p>As in 2021, secondary schools generally reported higher scores on the Part B SAT than did either primary schools or combined schools. This was particularly true for the Focus Areas, Data and School Climate.</p>
<p>Results by SES are shown below. Similar to the results from Part A, there is no clear pattern in scores in either 2021 or 2022, with low SES schools reporting similar or better results than high SES schools across the five Focus Areas.</p>

<p>Similar to results by SES, there is also no clear pattern of scores across Domains by ADII, with those below average on the ADII sometimes scoring lower than, and other times scoring higher than, above average ADII schools. In both years, however, below average ADII schools scored lower on the Data Focus Area as compared with above average ADII schools, and particularly in 2022.

<p>Based on the total score in Part B, schools can be assigned to one of four categories that represents where they currently sit in the eSmart Schools journey: Starting (quartile 1), Emerging (quartile 2), Building (quartile 3), or Flourishing (quartile 4). Such a designation can assist both the Foundation and schools to easily compare overall results across years – to understand where they currently sit and the progress they have made since their last self-assessment.</p>
<p>The four quartiles can also be used by the Foundation as a benchmarking exercise with schools – for example, to demonstrate to each school where it sits overall as compared with other schools from the same sector, SES or ADII status, or metropolitan or non-metropolitan area.</p>
<p>In the 2022 evaluation, six of the participating schools can be classified as Building (quartile 3) and six can be classified as Flourishing (quartile 4).</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="schools-perceptions-of-performance">Schools’ perceptions of performance</h2>
<p>Schools were asked, using a 10-point scale, to assess their preparedness for and responsiveness to an event or situation negatively affecting their school both before and after listening to the audio scenario and answering the Part B section of the SAT. These questions were included twice to understand if schools’ views would be impacted by their responses to the specific statements across the five Focus Areas; in other words – whether schools either overestimated or underestimated the extent to which their school is prepared to prevent and respond to disruptive events.</p>
<p>As can be seen from the figures below, schools were more likely to underestimate their preparedness and responsiveness than to overestimate them, both in 2021 but, even more so, in 2022. In 2022, eight of the participating schools reported a higher score after completing the Part B questions than prior when asked about preparedness, whereas none of the schools reported a lower score. In response to the question about responsiveness, seven of the schools reported a higher score after completing the Part B questions than prior, with just one school reporting a lower score.</p>
<p><code>Font is very small – difficult to read</code></p>
<p><code>We’ll need to differentiate between the two questions and between the two years.  Could you please make the first chart (upper left) lighter shades of blue and the third chart (bottom left) darker shades of blue; and then the second chart (upper right) lighter shades of green and the fourth chart (bottom right) darker shades of green?</code></p>
<p><strong>can you please confirm colours referring to item numbers?</strong></p>
<p><em>Note that in the link, there are a total of 6 of these charts – 3 for 2021 and 3 for 2022 – with different data. Which are correct?`</em></p>
<p><em>Please exclude from analysis any schools that did not answer both the pre- and post questions.</em></p>
<p><em>Same issue with other pie charts – if “No change” comes first in the legend, the “No Change” pie piece should be on the left, for each of comprehension.</em></p>

<p>On average, these schools reported decreases from 2021 to 2022 in the Part A Domains, Effective school organisation and eSmart Curriculum, but an increase in the Domain, Effective teacher practices. They reported the same level of achievement for the Domains, Respectful and caring school; School plans, policies, and procedures; and Community partnerships.</p>
<p>In 2022, these school reported 100% achievement in the Domains, Effective teacher practices; Respectful and caring school; and School plans, politics, and procedures. The lowest achievement was in the Domain, Effective school organisation. This was also the Domain with the largest drop in achievement from 2021.</p>
