Just an FYI that there may be data for one additional school.  I am waiting to hear back from the client.

When ready, are you able to send me an example of results -- perhaps one pie chart (demographics) and two versions of a bar chart -- one with the 2021 and 2022 data combined into a single chart and one with them separate?

Then if I have any questions/there's anything to discuss, we can always meet.

I was just thinking, it would probably be a good idea to add two bar charts that include the 2021 vs. 2022 results for the six schools that completed the instrument both years -- by Domain and total for Part A, and by Focus Area and total for Part B.

Also, are you able to send me the name and email address of the student who will be making the charts?  We'll need to arrange payment, etc.

Attached please find:
A copy of the 2021 report as a reference.  Please treat as confidential
The outline of the report for 2022 -- with examples of charts and notes about what to include
The 2021 and 2022 data
I think the main issue is whether to present each of the bar charts as a single chart combining 2021 and 2022, or separate charts.  Would it be possible to show me one of each and we can decide?
